# hydro_examples
*Simple one-dimensional examples of various hydrodynamics techniques*

This is a collection of simple python codes that demonstrate some basic
techniques used in hydrodynamics codes.  All the codes are *standalone* --
there are no interdependencies.

These codes go together with the lecture notes at:

and with the pyro2 code:
